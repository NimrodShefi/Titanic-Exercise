After making changes to your local repository, and you want to upload to github the changes that you did, 
follow these steps (speaking to you Ariel):

git add . (the . is if you want to add everything. If you want to add only specific files then git add filename or filepath if in subfolders)

git commit -m "message"

git push (this is to load the commits to github - you can have multiple commits before loading to github)


if someone else made changes to github and you want get those changes to your local repository, 
then you will need to follow these steps (speaking to you Ariel):

git pull
